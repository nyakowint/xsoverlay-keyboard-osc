Version 1.2.6 improves keyboard chatbox input for international keyboard layouts.

**If your language uses an IME** such as Japanese, Chinese, or Korean, support is not guaranteed. 

It is difficult to implement IME support due to how we capture and intercept inputs from XSOverlay's keyboard.
If you have any comments or insights on how to improve IME support, please open an issue or comment on https://github.com/nyakowint/xsoverlay-keyboard-osc/issues/6 !

In the meantime, if you are looking to input IME text, you can try these workarounds:
- Copy your message from a supported text field in windows, then paste into either chatbox using <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> while the bar is activated.
- There is a well-made *paid* program on BOOTH that supports IME input for VRChat: https://citrinelab.booth.pm/items/7047187
